description: I am a PhD student passionate about learning and research. My main research goal is to discover ways of
achieving generalization in machine learning models. I have expertise on representation learning using
generative models, Bayesian methods, geometry and group theory. I seek to work on challenging
projects that involve advanced mathematical reasoning to create novel solutions towards my research
goal. I enjoy working in teams and communicating my ideas to any audience.
